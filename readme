I have created application using PHP Laravel with mysql database.
Here are few steps to run the project
1. create two databases one for storing of data from xml file and second for testing (As I used mysql so I also used same db for testing)
2. import the table 'feeditems'(table available in project directory) to both databases.
3. Now run the command 'php artisan xml:import'
4. for testing run 'php artisan test'
5. Errors are stored in logs/laravel.log

We can also extend the application in future by different data storage and file types.
